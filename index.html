Their program relies heavily on the support of regular donors, medical partners, and volunteers to keep the gears turning.  However, on the original site poor navigation, repetitive content, and lack of a clear message made it difficult for potential users to complete tasks within the site.  Leading to a lack of motivation to continue learning about, and engaging with the Project CURE program.</p>

                    <p>The quickest way for an organization to lose that confidence is through misuse of funds and resources by overpaying staff and executives instead of truly helping those in need.</p>

                        Jennifer has always had a passion for helping others, hence becoming a nurse. After 
burning the midnight oil in the industry for many years she decided she was ready to 
give back in other ways. LA had become too crowded, and too expensive: she was 
ready to see the world. Through some friends at the hospital she heard about Project 
C.U.R.E., a program that allows her to harness a variety of her skills to help others 
around the globe. Places lacking with medical support, experience and tools needed 
for every day care and survival. She was able to start out volunteering sorting supplies at a 
local warehouse, taking a week long trip to a field hospital in Uganda, and eventually 
becoming a full time donor to the fundraisers she cares about most.
